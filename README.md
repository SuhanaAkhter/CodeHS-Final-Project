# CodeHS-Final-Project
This is my final project for the CodeHS Web Design (Picasso) course. I made this website after about half a year of learning html and css. The website basically reviews all different sorts of products (books, movies, electronics, etc.). There are no actual reviews on it since it was just something I made to showcase what I've learned.
